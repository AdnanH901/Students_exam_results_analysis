# Students Exam Results Analysis
## Business Understanding and questions
This project aims to figure out what exactly determines the success (or downfall) of different students? I wanted to see if any apparent hypotheses are oversights and if there are some hidden insights that I can find if so why? I have perviously completed a project based on Walmart Sales and I wanted to do some analysis that was more eduacationl as opposed to "how can I make this company more money". The questions explored were:
- h
- j

## Data Understanding
The data consists of one table with 20 columns showing different individual statistics and demographics of about 6000 students. I chose this dataset as it was rich with multiple columns of data which reduces the chances of confounding variables being present. The data also had previous scores which I could then compare with the final exam results for every student.

## Technologies
The data cleaning and analysis was done in SQL and the visualisations were generated using Tableau.
