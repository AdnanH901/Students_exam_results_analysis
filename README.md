# Students Exam Results Analysis
## Business Understanding and questions
This project aims to figure out what exactly determines the success (or downfall) of different students? I wanted to see if any apparent hypotheses are oversights and if there are some hidden insights that I can find if so why? I have perviously completed a project based on Walmart Sales and I wanted to do some analysis that was more eduacationl as opposed to "how can I make this company more money". The questions explored were:
- **Parental Involvement** - Should parents be more laid back or more proactive?
- **Access to Resources** - Does more access to resources necessarily mean better exam score?
- **Hard work vs Smart work** - Does spending more time working always result in higher grades?
- **Prior Exam Records** - Are prior exam records telling of a studentâ€™s final grade?
- **Public Or Private School** - Does a private school have more of an advantage over a state/ public school?
- **Physical Activities** - Does physical activities influence Exam Scores?


## Data Understanding
The data consists of one table with 20 columns showing different individual statistics and demographics of about 6,607 students. I chose this dataset as it was rich with multiple columns of data which reduces the chances of confounding variables being present. The data also had previous scores which I could compare with the final exam results for every student.

## Technologies
The data cleaning and analysis was done in **SQL** and the visualisations were generated using **Tableau**.

## Conclsions 
Please see the pdf for more information.
- **MORE PARENTAL SUPPORT** - Although the impact is small, students whose parents are more involved tend to perform better.
- **BETTER ACCESS TO RESOURCES** - There is a significant difference between students who do and do not have a lot of resources.
- **GREATER ATTENDANCE = BETTER GRADES** - School attendance has a clear impact on high performers and underperformers.
- **CONSISTENT SCHOOL RESULTS** - The type of school has little to no ettect on the final exam score.
- **MORE HOURS = BETTER GRADES** - Students who put in more hours studying regardless of skill/ attendance perform better.
- **UNREALISTIC PREVIOUS EXAMS** - The previous exams were a lot easier than the final exams not a clear indication of the final score of a student.
